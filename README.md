# Facial-Recognition
Contains Intro to OpenCV (Python Package), Face and Eye Detection, Face Storing, Face Recognition
Contains Jupyter Notebook IDE Files about all the steps required to gain knowledge about Face Recognition
Starts off with Introduction to OpenCV and all the important functions which are required to start the project
Step 1 : Detection of face and eye through webcam ( FACE & EYE DETECTION )
Step 2 : Includes Creating a DataSet of Images ( FACE STORING )
Step 3 : The DataSet needs to be trained using Machine Learning Algorithms these are already present in OpenCV ( FACE TRAINING )
Step 4 : Based on the Trained Model Faces are Recognized ( FACE RECOGNITION )

* Create an empty Folder named **"Dataset_Faces"** in the same directory where the python scripts are 
* Create an empty folder called **Trainer** In same directory
* Please Install latest Python and also required libraries for running the codes.
* Change the Path location whereever necessary
* Each Line contains comments for better understanding.
